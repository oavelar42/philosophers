<h3>I’ve never thought philosophy would be so deadly.</h3>

<h4>Several philosophers are sitting at a round table doing one of three things: eating,
thinking, or sleeping.
  
  - While eating, they are not thinking or sleeping, while sleeping, they are not eating
or thinking and of course, while thinking, they are not eating or sleeping.
  
  - The philosophers sit at a circular table with a large bowl of spaghetti in the center.
  
  - There are some forks on the table.
  
  - As spaghetti is difficult to serve and eat with a single fork, it is assumed that a
philosopher must eat with two forks, one for each hand.
  
  - The philosophers must never be starving.
  
  - Every philosopher needs to eat.
  
  - Philosophers don’t speak with each other.
  
  - Philosophers don’t know when another philosopher is about to die.
  
  - Each time a philosopher has finished eating, he will drop his forks and start sleeping. </h4>
